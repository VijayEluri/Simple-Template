What is SimpleTemplate?
SimpleTemplate is a simple (obvious) template engine written in Java.
SimpleTemplate is inspired by StringTemplate (http://www.stringtemplate.org) but
not based on any code from it.

Using SimpleTemplate you can generate formatted text from a Java bean. You can
use it for generating XML files, websites.

Differences with StringTemplate
1. No support for high level features like groups and subtemplates yet.
2. Support for aliases using <with> and <set> template operations.
3. Indexed access into lists, maps and arrays.
